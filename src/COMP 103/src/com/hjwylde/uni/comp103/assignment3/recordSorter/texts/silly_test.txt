bollards
dip stick
dum bass

old mouldy chewed bone
smarties and jaffas beat javas cassavas
a smelly dog has its own culture
sofa bed, lost chicken, I really do need to get this assignment in the bag.
strong pet food stroganof has one muscle, but it fails to pull.
lost sock

We are lumberjacks, we sleep all day.
Lumberjacks only come out at night, they only come out at night.
Portia's trumpington pillock in an olive sauce.
Poetry in motion.

Everyone is after me to jump through hoops,
whoop it up, play football,
rush about, even go swimming and flying.
Fair enough.

Everyone is after me to take it easy,
They all make doctor's appointments for me,
eyeing me in that quizzical way.
What is going on?

WHAT IS GOING ON?
