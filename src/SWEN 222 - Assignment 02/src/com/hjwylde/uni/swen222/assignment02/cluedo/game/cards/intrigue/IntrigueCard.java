/**
 * An intrigue card is an extra rule-set added in to the game of Clue. An intrigue card is either a
 * clock card or a keeper card. With clock cards, there are 8 in the game and the player that picks
 * up the 8th clock card is removed from the game. Player's may pick up keeper cards and store them
 * for use for special abilities at various times throughout the game.
