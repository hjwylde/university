Hi there, just a few notes on modified classes

All of the classes were modified slightly, except for Direction. The reason for this is to include a "size()" or "radius()" function mostly, or to fix bugs. The Quadtree class is my implementation of a Quadtree, and I have included my QuadtreeTest class if you would like to see a visual representation of it (the comments at the top in that class explains more).

Thanks,
Henry
