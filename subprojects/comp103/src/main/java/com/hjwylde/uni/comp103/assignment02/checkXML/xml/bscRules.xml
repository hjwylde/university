<RECOMMENDATION>
Up to 48pts of non-science courses required by the major(s) can be counted as
science for the "at most 90pts non-science" rule. Can they also be counted for
the "at least 120 points of science at 200+" or the "at least 72 points of
science at 300"?  I have assumed not.

After discussion with Helen, we felt that up to 24pt of the 300 level
non-science courses required by a major should be counted as science for the "at
least 72 points of science at 300" rule.

This would change the last points requirement above to:
        (72p - min(24p, %nonScienceMajor300Points): 300, (BSC, BSCHON))
</RECOMMENDATION>

<RECOMMENDATION>
non-science points should not have an upper limit, but the number of science
points should have a lower limit - want to encourage students to take courses
rather than discourage them.
</RECOMMENDATION>

<RECOMMENDATION>
Should the 30 pt double limit should be per pair of majors? rather than overall
</RECOMMENDATION>

<PROBLEM> ????? Do the 200 level papers specified in the major have to be part
of the degree, or could they be done for another degree?  I assume the latter.

Is this only an issue for cross crediting, or is it more general.  I think that
if they are not cross crediting the papers (in which case everything would work
out fine) then they would need a special exemption.  Therefore, this would be
hand checked.

 <RECOMMEND>
 The Environmental Studies major , part (a) does not look right - it looks as though some courses are missing
 after BIOL 132.  I have assumed it means one paper from that list, but it is ambiguous.
 </RECOMMENDATION>

<PROBLEM>
   Note that the recording of the nonscience papers only matters for the BSc, not for the BA.
   In fact, it must NOT record them if the major is for the BA!!!

<Clause>
2. Subject to this statute, and except as otherwise specifically provided, the
 personal course of study of each candidate shall consist of papers (the
 prescriptions for which shall be defined in the Calendar of Victoria
 University of Wellington) selected from the schedule to this statute, provided
 that
 -  not more than 90 pts may be included from papers for any first degree of
     Victoria University of Wellington other than BSc. 

 -  ****** Up to a further 48 pts of papers not listed in the schedule to this statute,
    but specified in a subject requirement in Section 5 of the statute, and
    taken in order to satisfy Section 5 of the statute, may also be included. 

 - The course of study shall have a total point value of not less than 360, 

 - of which at least 180 shall be from papers numbered 200-399

 - and of these at least 120 shall be from papers in the schedule to this
    statute 

 - including at least 72 from papers numbered 300-399 in that schedule.  

 With the approval of the Associate Dean (Students) on the
 recommendation of the Head of School concerned, a candidate may include in
 their personal course of study papers from the Schedule to the degree of
 BSc(Hons). For the purposes of this statute, such papers shall be regarded as
 if they were numbered in the range 300-399 and listed in the schedule to the
 Statute, except that they may not be used to satisfy any requirement that
 specifies a particular paper at 300-level or papers numbered within a range
 narrower than 300-399.
</Clause>


<Clause> Cross-Credits and Exemptions
6. At the discretion of the Associate Dean (Students), up to 160 pts in papers
   common to the BSc degree and any other course of study may be credited to
   both courses of study.  In any such case a candidate's course of study for
   the BSc degree shall satisfy the requirements of Section 2 hereof and
   include 180 pts in papers numbered 200399 not credited to any other course
   of study as part of the prescribed minimum of advanced work for that
   course. At least 120 of these shall be from papers in the schedule to this
   statute including at least 72 from papers numbered 300-399 in that
   schedule.

 Note: 	Candidates whose other course of study is a first degree will be
        granted up to 160 pts. Candidates whose other course of study is not a
        first degree (e.g. a diploma) will be granted a smaller number of
        pts. Enquiries regarding eligibility under this section should be
        addressed to the Manager, Student Administration Office. 
</Clause>

<Clause> Direct Entry to Papers Numbered 200-299
7. In Chemistry, Mathematics and Physics, notwithstanding anything contained in
 this statute, a candidate who has attained a sufficiently high standard before
 matriculating may, with the permission of the Head of School, enrol in a paper
 of level 200-299 without having passed the prerequisite at level 100-199 in
 the same subject. If the paper is passed at the higher level, the candidate
 shall not be credited with the paper at the lower level. If the examiner
 certifies that the candidate, although failing in the higher-level paper,
 attained the standard of a pass in the lower-level paper then such a pass will
 be credited.  
</Clause>

<Clause> Transition from Earlier Regulations
 8. When an amendment to the BSc statute results in a change of requirements
 for candidates who have not yet completed the degree, they may complete it
