Comments:
------------------
The xml file has 2 errors in the tags, the <sides> and </lid> tag are the wrong way around, and the </box> and </sides> tag are the wrong way around.

The program detected that there were errors in the tags, that it expected a different tag than to that which was received. However, it reported the tag errors roughly, it was not able to accurately tell what the problem was exactly with the tags.
