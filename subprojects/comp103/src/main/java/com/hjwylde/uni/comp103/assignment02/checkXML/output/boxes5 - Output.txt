Comments:
------------------
The xml file has 1 error in it, a missing </sides> tag.

The program detected this error, however there were flow-on errors when the rest of the tags were infact correct. It then thought that there was an error with the </box> tag as it was still looking for a </sides> tag. When it found the error with the </box>, it would then remove the </box> tag, meaning that the <box> tag would have no closing partner. Thus meaning the next closing tag, </boxcollection> would throw an error as it was still looking for a </box> tag.
Also note, after the correction to the program for finding left-over open tags that were not closed (made after box3 results were incorrect, see comments on the box3 - Output.txt) a new error was thrown, one that said <boxcollection> was not closed properly, which is due to the same reason as above, where the closing tag for <boxcollection> was used and taken off the stack for a different open tag.
