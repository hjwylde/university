For your reflection:
====================

Learning about iterators and comparators is "bitsy" and can be quite
tricky. These are inevitably quite technical concepts rather than "big
picture" ones, but they're good to have in your repertoire.  Different
people find them challenging in different ways.

What aspect of this material do you think was the most difficult to
grasp, for you personally? (Note that you can answer this regardless
of *how* difficult it was). Do you imagine other people found the same
things challenging, or is this specific to your background?  Comment
on whether you understood this challenging aspect better as you did
the assignment, or not, and why.

I did not feel that this material was too dificult. If I had to pick an aspect that I thought was the hardest, I would say probably knowing how the Collections class chooses to sort the objects in a collection and understanding how they classify the different methods sorting performances/speeds. Actual implementation of the Comparable and Comparator interfaces was straightforward.
 - Specific to my background?
 I don't quite understand what this means, but personally I have enjoyed programming for some years now, if that is what it is refering to.
I don't quite know how other people would have found it, I would guess that it wouldn't be too dificult for them, possibly just simply remembering the difference between the Comparable and Comparator interfaces and what returning -1 in the method means in terms of the order (as in, does -1 mean the first object is before the second, personally I forgot this a number of times and had to check).

It was more a bit of reading/searching I did that helped me to understand the aspect I found challenging. Namely, the course textbook is useful for helping to understand it a lot. The assignment didn't specifically involve different sorting methods that allowed me to experiment with them.
