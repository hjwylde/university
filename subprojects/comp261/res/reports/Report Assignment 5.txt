What parts I did:

I did all of the functions except for completing the sort-merge algorithm in the HeapFile. I attempted it, and completed the initial sort phase part, but did not finish the merge phase. It is possible to view the outputs of the sort phase by just clicking the sort button - it will simply sort the records for every run of n-1 blocks.

The code is all commented as to what each method does exactly.

The SequentialFile.delete() I wrote simply uses the binary search method indexOf() for fast searches to find out whether the record is contained and if it is, where it is. I then simply shift down all the records one position starting from the end of the sequential file and going down towards the index found of the record to be deleted. It then will delete the last block if there are no records left within it.

The difference between the heap file and sequential file implementations is mainly in the searching algorithms. The sequential file uses a binary search to find the index of a file, and always returns its correct index position (if it isn't present, it will return -index - 1), while the heap file uses a linear search and if returning the index of a file that isn't present it will only return -eof - 1 rather than its actual position. This means the write method for heap file always writes at the end rather than anywhere in the middle. Also for the write method the heap file allows overwritting of records whlie the sequential file does not.
