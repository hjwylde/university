Type
  I can't find out what the road type means.


Speed limit categories:
  This is an important attribute for calculating good routes - a slightly
  longer route that has a faster speed limit is better than a shorter route
  with a slower speed limit
(Note, these are not accurate representations of the real Auckland speed
limits, but they are the best we have. You may use them as if they were
correct.) 

   0 = 5km/h    
   1 = 20km/h   
   2 = 40km/h   
   3 = 60km/h   
   4 = 80km/h   
   5 = 100km/h  
   6 = 110km/h  
   7 = no limit 


Road class:
 This is the other important attribute for calculating good routes - roads of a
 higher class are considered to be "faster" or at least "better".

   0 = Residential
   1 = Collector
   2 = Arterial 
   3 = Principal HW
   4 = Major HW 


One_way:
   	0 : both directions allowed
      	1 : one way road, direction from beginning to end

notforcar, notforpedestrians, notforbicycle
        0 : OK for this category of traffic
	1 : Not useable by this category of traffic
